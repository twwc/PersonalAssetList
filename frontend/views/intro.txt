    PAL: Personal Asset List v1.0

                                                 -- Introduction --

    PAL was developed to help you keep track of your personal assets.
    Types of assets PAL was designed to help with:

    - Financial; includes banking accounts (savings/checking) and
      credit accounts.

    - Technology; includes hardware, computers, servers, workstations,
      routers, switches, ISPs, and IoT devices.

    - Software Licenses; includes any licenses purchased for access and/or
      activation of software products.

    - Online Accounts; includes social media accounts, email accounts,
      subscriptions, etc. (PAL does not store passwords to online accounts)

    *PAL provides an option to create a secret key to keep your personal
    assets safe. The key is never stored in plaintext but hashed
    (one-way irreversible encryption) and stored in a database. The key
    will be used to access PAL as well as adding, editing, or removing
    any existing assets, ensuring the security of your assets.
